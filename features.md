# Welcome Globetrotter

## This is a simple site for you to tell us about your travels

### Think of it as an instant blog. Take a picture, write a comment and show your friends all the great places you've been.

1. You can add yourself to the main page and it will create your profile. The use of a password is still in construction. 

2. From there, you can begin creating posts. 

3. Add an image and commment on your post. Once you submit, you will be directed to your posts page where all of your posts are contained.

4. From the posts page, you can click on each individual post to read more and leave a comment, or more importantly tell your friends to leave a comment. 

5. If you need to add, edit or delete any posts or comments, travel to the respective page and there will be a link or button for those actions towards the bottom of the page. 

6. See, simple and easy. Happy blogging!
