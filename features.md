# Welcome Globetrotter

## This is a simple site for you to tell us about your travels

### Think of it as an instant blog. Load a picture, write a comment and show your friends all the great places you've been.

1. You can add yourself to the main page and it will create your profile. 

2. The password setup ist still a primitive one but you can use to edit your page, make a new post, and to delete your profile and posts. If you entered it incorrectly, it will redirect you to the previous page.

3. After creating your profile, you can begin creating posts. 

4. Add an image and commment on it. Once you submit, you will be directed to your posts page where all of your posts are contained.

5. From the posts page, you can click on each individual post to read more and leave a comment, or more importantly tell your friends to leave a comment. 

6. If you need to add, edit or delete any posts, travel to the respective page and there will be a button for those actions towards the bottom of the page where those actions can be carried out provided the password is correct. 

7. Anyone can add or delete comments. If you made a mistake, simply delete your old one and post a new one.

8. See, nice and easy. Happy blogging!

### How the app works: 

App 1 --- * Backpacker 1 --- * Post 1 --- * Comments

- * = many
- 1 = one
